# Random Forest Classification and Backtesting with S&P 500 Data

This repository contains a data analysis and machine learning project focused on predicting stock market movements using Random Forest Classification and evaluating the model's accuracy through backtesting. The project utilizes data from the Yahoo Finance library, specifically the S&P 500 dataset.

## Project Overview

In this project, we aim to:
- Apply Random Forest Classification to predict stock market movements.
- Utilize the S&P 500 data from the Yahoo Finance library as our dataset.
- Assess the accuracy of the Random Forest model by performing backtesting on historical data.
